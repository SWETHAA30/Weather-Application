# Weather-Application
This weather application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with real-time weather data for any location worldwide by utilizing a third-party weather API.

# Features:
[] The application fetches current weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, using a third-party API.
[] Users can search for the weather in any city or location by entering the name in the search bar.
[] The interface is fully responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
[] Weather information is dynamically updated without needing to refresh the page, providing a seamless user experience.

# How It Works:
[] The application uses OpenWeatherMap to retrieve weather data. API requests are made using JavaScript's fetch method.
[] Users enter a city name into the search field, and the application sends a request to the API to fetch the corresponding weather data.
[] The fetched data is parsed and displayed in the application, showing the current weather, temperature, and other relevant details.
